	"content":"<p>The California Gull (<i>Larus californicus</i>) is a gull native to the western United States. The gull looks a bit like the Herring Gull. distinguishing characteristics include a black ring on a yellow bill, yellow legs and a rounder head.</p>\r\n<p>Adults have gray and white bodies with black primary feathers. Juveniles have brown plumage.</p>\r\n<p>The California Gull is very common in the San Francisco Bay area. The bay isn't their historic habitat--that is the salty Mono Lake on the Nevada border. Their abundance in the bay area is attributed to their breeding in the salt pond of the south bay, and abundant food from bay area landfills</p>"
